# Pricing-Test
An in depth analysis of a pricing strategy with interactive data visualizations and pricing A/B test comparison using a bayesian vs frequentist approach

Pricing_Test_Part_1.ipynb contains the write up for the first half of the analysis.  Pricing_Test_Part_2.pdf
contains the bayesian vs frequentist A/B test comparison.  

Conversion_Count_map.html, Conversion_Mean_map.html, and Missed_Conversion_map.html are interactive maps that
can be opened in any internet browser.  I recommend downloading the repo as it makes it easier to open these files.  Graphs/Visuals from the A/B price test comparison are also included.

The scripts directory contains all the python scripts I used for this project.
